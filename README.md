The following is the results of ~5 months of work implementing detection and tracking via Faster RCNN and SORT, respectively. 
I subsequently outlined the limitations/bottlenecks of these state-of-the-art algorithms and proposed possible solutions and
implemented these ideas in python, specifically targetting detecting and tracking through occlusions. 

The contents of this project are too large to upload to github. I have attached a dropbox link to a zip file
that contains a video of my imlementation of the tracking algorithm, as well as a report that contains an in-depth explanation
of all my work; transfer learning for improved detections via FrRCNN (+results), SORT for tracking (+results), my proposals,
their implmentations, and their results. 

I will upload all my code shortly. 

Unfortuatnely, due to the nature of the work, I will not be able to share the dataset/annotations.
