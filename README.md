# Multi-Object-Detection and Tracking in Hockey

The following is the results of ~5 months of an indepenent research project, working on multi-object detection and tracking in Hockey in the Vision and Image Processing Lab.

Over the course of these 5 months, I implemented detection and tracking in Hockey via Faster RCNN (FrRCNN) and SORT, respectively, as well as some new ideas I had to improve their performance. After establishing the benchmark performance with these state-of-the-art algorithms, I proposed possible solutions to their bottlenecks and implemented these ideas in python, specifically targetting detecting and tracking through occlusions. 

The contents of this project are too large to upload to github. I have attached a dropbox link to a zip file
that contains a video of my imlementation of the tracking algorithm, as well as a report that contains an in-depth explanation
of all my work; transfer learning for improved detections via FrRCNN (+results), SORT for tracking (+results), my proposals,
their implmentations, and their results. 

I will upload all my code shortly. 

Unfortuatnely, due to the nature of the work, I will not be able to share the dataset/annotations.
